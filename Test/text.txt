Did you know you can protect your profile with a PIN?
A profile on your account currently has access to the full catalog and that profile is not protected with a PIN.

A profile PIN prevents accidental access to your profile. This helps keep you in control of what content other members of your household can watch on a protected profile.

The PIN will be used to access your profile. You do not need to enter the PIN to watch individual shows and movies.

You can make changes to your Parental Control settings at any time by heading to Edit Profiles from your mobile app or web browser.
